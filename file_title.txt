Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing computer systems capable of learning from data and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms to analyze and interpret patterns in large datasets, enabling them to recognize and generalize information. Machine learning algorithms learn iteratively from examples, adjusting their parameters to improve performance over time. They can be used for various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. By leveraging statistical techniques and computational power, machine learning enables computers to automate complex tasks and make accurate predictions, contributing to advancements in many fields, including healthcare, finance and technology.
